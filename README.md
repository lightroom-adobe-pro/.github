Lightroom features an intuitive interface organized into four main sections: Home, Discover, My Photos, and Learn. The design uses a dark theme with subtle visual feedback - selected tools light up against the charcoal background.

The application excels at cataloging photographs, allowing users to:

1. Upload and sync images across devices via cloud storage
